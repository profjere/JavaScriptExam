# JavaScript Exam

##COMM 468: Javascript Exam (150 points)
*Write the first two question in Microsoft Word. The rest can be done in code.  Visual Studio Code or Brackets is strongly encouraged as you can test in Chrome and check errors in the console.  To hand this in, label each file name with your name and question number (i.e., Smith_2.html, Smith_2.js) You must work over two files. Zip everything (including the Word document) and e-mail it to me. I will give partial credit.*

I.	(10 points) What is the difference between these two sets of variables? Why is one likely more effective than the other?
a) pizza1, pizza2, pizza3, pizza4, pizza5
b) pizza[1], pizza[2], pizza[3], pizza[4], pizza[5] 

II.	(10 points) Assuming you had to write this game:
http://www.freepacman.org/
How might you organize the code in functions?

For questions 3-5, only a javascript page is required. It doesn’t need to write to an HTML page.

III.	(15 points) Write a statement in JavaScript that prints the following to the console:

**0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90**

This must be done in two lines of code, not counting curly brackets.  No semicolons may be included (nor are necessary).  If your code requires a semicolon to run, it won’t be accepted for full credit.

IV.	(15 points) Write an if…then statement in JavaScript that checks if a variable named friend is greater than 3 and a variable named enemy is less than 8.  If both are true, the program writes “Forget it” to the console.  Otherwise, the program writes “Why not?” to the console.

V.	(20 points) Write a “book” object that takes as arguments: title, genre, author, and whether or not it’s in stock (available).  Assume it always is in stock when the program starts.  One method should put the book in stock and a second method should take the book out of stock.  Declare three instances of the book.  Use any made-up book information, real or not real, that you wish, for the three instances.

VI.	(20 points) Debug the guessing.html and guessing.js available at:
https://github.com/profjere/JavaScriptExam (Note: don’t worry about validating that the guess is a number-I promised no regular expressions.)

Write the next three programs: one file each for HTML and JavaScript.  Please comment the lines and/or blocks of code (at least three times each). NOTE: there cannot be any JavaScript in the HTML page. It must all be done on the javascript page.

VII.	(30 points) Write a program that randomly prints any number to the screen.  [This only requires three lines of code.]

VIII.	(30 points) Write a program that randomly generates a new sentence in the following format: NOUN VERB. There should be at least six nouns and six verbs (so 36 different combinations.) [This only requires six lines of code.]

IX.	BONUS QUESTION: 30 points onto your overall points in the course. Write a program that accepts input from the user to redo the color of the background of the entire screen.
